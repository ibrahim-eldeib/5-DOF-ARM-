5-DOF Robotic Arm: CAD to System Dynamics and Control ( AI Generated description) 
This repository demonstrates the process of modeling, simulating, and controlling a 5-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Simscape Multibody and the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox. The project guides users through transitioning from a CAD model to a complete system dynamics and control framework, showcasing tools for multibody dynamics and robotic control.

Overview
The 5-DOF robotic arm serves as a practical example for engineers and researchers interested in robotics, multibody dynamics, and control systems. This demo illustrates:

Importing a CAD model into Simscape Multibody for dynamic simulation.
Developing a system dynamics model for the robotic arm.
Implementing control strategies using the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox.


Implement Control:

Use the provided scripts (--.m) to apply control algorithms via the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox.
Modify control parameters as needed for your use case.


Visualize Results:

Use MATLAB plotting functions or Simscape visualization to analyze the arm's motion.
